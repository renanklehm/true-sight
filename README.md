# TrueSight âœ¨

The TrueSight model is a hybrid forecasting tool that uses statistical forecasting models together with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to make predictions. The TrueSight `Preprocessor` class is responsible for getting all the statistical forecasters in one place. It can handle forecasters from packages like `statsforecast`, `scikit-learn`, `pmdarima`, and others. You just need to the `ModelWrapper` Class to standardize the method calls.

All you need to do before using this package, is create a pandas dataframe with the following structure:

 - unique_id: A string that uniquely identifies each time series in the dataframe
 - ds: A datetime column with the date of each time step. The dates must be in the correct frequency for the date_freq parameter
 - y: The values of the time series

and run the steps in the Usage section. Easy peasy! ðŸ˜Ž

## Instalation ðŸ’»

To install the TrueSight package, just run:

```
pip install truesight
```

We also recommend installing the `statsforecast` package for the statistical forecasters:

```
pip install statsforecast
```

## Usage ðŸš€

Import the necessary modules

``` python
import tensorflow as tf
from truesight.preprocessing import Preprocessor
from truesight.core import TrueSight
from truesight.metrics import Evaluator, smape, mape, mse, rmse, mae
from truesight.utils import get_input_shapes, generate_syntetic_data
```

Load the data

``` python
num_time_steps = 60
season_length = 12
forecast_horizon = 12
df = generate_syntetic_data(num_time_steps, season_length, 100)
```
Create and run the preprocessor class. You can include as many statistical models as you need in the `models` parameter, just make sure to use the `ModelWrapper` class. However, keep in mind that more models mean longer processing time. It's important to set a fallback model in case any of the informed models fail to fit.

``` python
from statsforecast.models import SeasonalNaive, AutoETS
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from truesight.models import AdditiveDecomposition
from truesight.utils import ModelWrapper

models = [
    ModelWrapper(LinearRegression, horizon=forecast_horizon, season_length=season_length), 
    ModelWrapper(SeasonalNaive, horizon=forecast_horizon, season_length=season_length), 
    ModelWrapper(AutoETS, horizon=forecast_horizon, season_length=season_length),
    ModelWrapper(AdditiveDecomposition, horizon=forecast_horizon, season_length=season_length)
]

preprocessor = Preprocessor(df)
X_train, Y_train, ids_train, X_val, Y_val, ids_val, models = preprocessor.make_dataset(
    forecast_horizon = 12, 
    season_length = 12,
    date_freq = "MS", 
    models = models, 
    fallback_model = ModelWrapper(SeasonalNaive, horizon=forecast_horizon, season_length=season_length),
    verbose = True
    )
```

Create the model

``` python
input_shapes = get_input_shapes(X_train)
truesight = TrueSight(models, input_shapes, forecast_horizon = forecast_horizon)
truesight.auto_tune(X_train, Y_train, X_val, Y_val, n_trials = 50, batch_size = 512, epochs = 5)
```

Use the `auto_tune` to automatically define the hyperparameters

``` python
truesight.auto_tune(X_train, Y_train, X_val, Y_val, n_trials = 10, batch_size = 512, epochs = 5)
```

Or set then manually

``` python
truesight.set_hparams(lstm_units=256, hidden_size=1024, num_heads=8, dropout_rate=0.1)
```

Train the model, as the model is built on the tensorflow framework, any tensorflow callback can be used

``` python
callbacks = [
    tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(patience = 100, restore_best_weights = True, monitor = "val_loss"),
    tf.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor = "val_loss", factor = 0.5, patience = 25, verbose = 1),
]
truesight.fit(
    X_train, Y_train, 
    X_val, Y_val, 
    batch_size = 128, 
    epochs = 1000, 
    verbose = False, 
    callbacks = callbacks,
 )
truesight.plot_history()
```

Evaluate the results

``` python
Y_hat = truesight.predict(
    X_val, 
    batch_size = 500, 
    n_repeats = 100, 
    n_quantiles = 15, 
    return_quantiles = True, 
    verbose = False,
 )
evaluator = Evaluator(X_val, Y_val, Y_hat, ids_val)
evaluator.evaluate_prediction([smape, mape, mse, rmse, mae], return_mean=False)
```
